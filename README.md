[BRIEF GAME DESCRIPTION]

Drag, aim, release the CATTO! CATTO was just chilling in a breezy grassy green plain when suddenly various things start appearing of out nowhere! Try to stay alive as long as you can~

 P.S. No cats will be harmed in the playing of this game

​[DEV MESSAGE]

CATTO is my first ever game jam project, it ain't much but it's fun work. As of writing this there's a few good hours left before the game jam's submission deadline. I really wanted to put a few more polish here and there such as VFX particles when grabbing an item or when the cat moves, or animating the cat even more, but my eyes and head are really heavy right now. There were some stumbles here and there when I uploaded the project on this itch.io page, such as the game not working, then the UI didn't work, and even more things not working. That's game shipping for ya! Redesigning the game during coding over and over, as my plans weren't concrete enough and being too big of a scope was pretty painful, at least next time I know how to plan for a 3-day game jam.

The current iteration of CATTO's feels just right when I play-tested it, I'm not sure how other players would feel, I'd be grateful you'd leave a feedback after playing it! Especially about its level design, cat movement and feel, and its difficulty level.

And if you are here, I thank you. Any feedbacks to the source code is greatly appreciated!
